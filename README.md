# docker-lampp

Development environment with:

* Apache
* Debian
* MariaDB
* PHP 7
* PHP 5
* phpMyAdmin

PHP included in this bundle uses the [php](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) image with apache tag,
which also uses the [debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) image.

This bundle includes both, PHP 7 and PHP 5, so you can work in projects with different version at
the same time.
